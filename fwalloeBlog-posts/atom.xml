        <title>What do you mean I can't hack that?</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I first took an interest in information security when studying Journalism in London. Wikileaks has just made a splash thanks to Chelsea Manning and with her arrest it became clear that if I wanted to be a journalist, I had to find ways to keep sources safe. This led to an extended foray into infosec, through which I learned how to encrypt emails and later discovered Tails – the amnesiac incognito live Linux OS.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Data-driven journalism</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;This section of the blog will contain mainly data-driven journalism, where statics and other open data are used as a central part of journalistic storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>In Autumn</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;An autumn leaf stuck in a fence. Took this when walking to work a few years ago in Oslo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Affection</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across this intimate mural of two women in a vibrant part of Stavanger – the 'oil capital' of Norway – right next to a gay bar. Note the crack in the wall, which cuts accross one lover's arm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Ava flung herself at her mother and waited for Dad to shoot the dog.&lt;/p&gt;
